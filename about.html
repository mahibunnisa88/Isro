            Organisation (ISRO) </b> India's national space agency, founded on August 15, 1969, with its headquarters in
            &nbsp;Bengaluru.
            It replaced the Indian National Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR), which had been established in 1962
            under the &nbsp;Department of Atomic Energy at the suggestion of <b>Dr. Vikram Sarabhai</b>, widely regarded as the
            father of the Indian space program.
            &nbsp;Early History and Founding Satellite research in India began in the early <b>1960s </b>when global satellite
            applications were in their infancy.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Vikram Sarabhai led
            the effort to harness space technology for addressing real-life challenges in India, primarily
            communication, &nbsp;broadcasting, meteorology, and resource management.
            INCOSPAR's first notable accomplishment was the launch of a sounding rocket &nbsp;from the <b>Thumba Equatorial
            Rocket Launching Station (TERLS)</b> 1963. was set up in 1969 to expand the vision and activities
            &nbsp;established under INCOSPAR, and later brought under the newly formed Department of Space in 1972.</p>
            <br>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Major Milestones
            ISRO launched its first satellite, <b>Aryabhata</b>, with the help of the Soviet Union on April 19, <b>1975.</b>
            In 1980, ISRO successfully launched the <b>Rohini satellite (RS-1)</b> using an indigenous launch vehicle (SLV-3),
            making India the seventh nation to achieve this feat.In 1980, ISRO successfully launched the Rohini
            satellite (RS-1) using an indigenous launch vehicle (SLV-3), making India the seventh nation to achieve this
            feat.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The space agency
            developed and expanded its capabilities with a range of rockets: the Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV), the
            Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), and the Geostationary Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV), as well as
            their variants for different orbits and payloads.Key Programs and Achievements<b>The Indian National Satellite System (INSAT)</b>
        , launched in 1988, revolutionized India's telecommunications
            and broadcasting sectors, alongside the Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) program for resource monitoring.Landmark
            missions include
            Chandrayaan-1 (2008) (2008), India's first lunar orbiter; Mangalyaan or Mars Orbiter Mission (2013), which made
            India the first Asian nation to reach Martian orbit; <b>Chandrayaan-2 (2019), and Chandrayaan-3 (2023)</b>
            In January 2025, ISRO successfully performed its first space docking experiment, making India the fourth
            country to demonstrate this technology.

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Structure and
            Contributions
            ISRO operates through a network of research, development, and mission centers, with the main ones being
            <b>Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC)</b>, U R Rao Satellite Centre (URSC), Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC), and
            others across India.Its achievements span satellite design, launch vehicles, remote sensing, navigation
            (IRNSS/NavIC), meteorology, and international collaborations. ISRO is also preparing for its first manned
            mission, Gaganyaan, targeted for launch in 2026.<br>

    <p>August 23 is celebrated as National Space Day in India to honor the historic achievement of ISRO's Chandrayaan-3 mission, which successfully achieved a soft landing on the Moon’s south pole on August 23, 2023. This marked India as the first nation to land near the Moon’s south polar region and the fourth country overall to soft-land on the Moon. Prime Minister Narendra Modi officially declared August 23 as National Space Day to commemorate this major milestone and to inspire future generations in space science, technology, and innovation.
ISRO and the Indian government organize national-level events, panel discussions, exhibitions, and educational outreach programs in schools and universities.

Annual themes tie together India’s past and future in space exploration, and various activities aim to inspire youth and raise scientific curiosity across the country.
The landing site of Chandrayaan-3 was named “Shiv Shakti Point” to further memorialize the achievement.

The first National Space Day was celebrated on August 23, 2024, with ongoing annual observance on the same date.</p>
