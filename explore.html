    <h2> Services</h2><br>
    <h3>Launch Services(SSLV,PSLV,GSLV, andLVM3)</h3>
    
    <p>Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SHAR) at Sriharikota, 80 km from Chennai, is India‚Äôs main spaceport with two launch pads. Its near-equatorial location makes it ideal for global launches.<br> Established in 1971, it now hosts large production, propellant, and range facilities, plus housing and guest¬†amenities.</p>
    <p>Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SHAR) at Sriharikota, 80 km from Chennai, is India‚Äôs main spaceport with two active launch pads ‚Äì FLP and SLP.
    </p>
    <p>It began in 1971 with a sounding rocket and now has world-class facilities for solid motor production, propellant servicing, testing, and housing for staff and visitors.
    </p>
    <P>FLP (First Launch Pad), built in the 1990s, uses the ‚ÄúIntegrate on Pad‚Äù concept with a 3,200-ton Mobile Service Tower; active since 1993 with 37 launches.
    </P>
    <p>SLP (Second Launch Pad), operational from 2005, follows the ‚ÄúIntegrate, Transfer and Launch‚Äù concept with a Vehicle Assembly Building and rail transfer; 24 launches so far.
    </p>
    <p>Both pads support launches to LEO, GEO, Sub-GTO</p><br>

    <h2>Programmes</h2><br>

    <h3>Academics Course Under DOS</h3>

    <p>  ISRO‚Äôs academic programmes are offered mainly through IIST (Thiruvananthapuram) and IIRS (Dehradun).

    IIRS: Premier institute for capacity building in Remote Sensing, GIS and applications; offers M.Tech., M.Sc., PG Diploma and short-term courses (1 week‚Äì2 years). Hosts UN-affiliated CSSTE-AP for Asia-Pacific training.

    Academic Collaboration: DA-IICT, AAU and IIRS jointly run a two-year M.Sc. in Agriculture Analytics combining agriculture and data analytics.

    IIST: Asia‚Äôs first Space University, offers undergraduate to post-doctoral programmes in space science, technology and applications.

   (Details and registration at respective institute¬†websites.)</p><br>
